# SpringEffect
A lib to add bouncing edge effect to all kinds of view based widgets.
SpringRelativeLayout is from AOSP Launcher3 app.
It works with RecyclerView in Launcher3.
this project adapted SpringRelativeLayout to different kinds of scrollable U.I.
ListView/GridView/[Horizontal]ScrollView/WebView
and make the same edge effect.

And, More...
A idea to make custom view bouncing itself (without SpringRelativeLayout).
I overwrite 
SpringRecyclerView/SpringListView2/SpringScrollView2/SpringNestedScrollView 
to do the same effect itself.

Samples are also given for all custom View widget.
